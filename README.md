# Virtual-KeyAnalyzer
I am including 2 python scripts for analysis of keyboard activities along with virtual keyboard activities which will remove the myth that virtual keyboard cannot be traced. Basically this will log the keyboard activities and for virtual keyboard it will take a screenshot of the particular area this way we can gather all the information regarding the sensitive information like passwords.

# Instructions
- You have to fill in the location for storing the image/logs and if you want you can change the extension as well. 
- You need to Download librarys like :- pynput and pyscreenshot.
- Python version supported 3.x and above (although not tested in 2.x).
